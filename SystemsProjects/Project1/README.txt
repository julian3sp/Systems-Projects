Description:
Harriet the hare, Tucker the Tortoise and Billy the bumblebee are 
racing eachother on a racecourse on a slippery mountainside. Each second,
each animal has a certain percent chance of moving foward, backwards
(except the bee), or to not move at all. The first animal to reach square 70 
wins the race! Use this code when you would like to see the different outcomes
of this old fable, this time with a new character. Additionally, this project 
displays how randomization can lead to many different outcomes.

Compile.Running Program Instructions: (typed into terminal)
Compile: 'gcc race.c animals.c -o theRace'
Running: './theRace'
and then enter a number when prompted
